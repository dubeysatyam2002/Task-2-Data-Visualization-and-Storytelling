📊 Superstore Data Visualization & Storytelling (Tableau)

This project is a complete data-visualization and storytelling exercise created as part of Task 2: Data Visualization & Storytelling.
Using Tableau and the Superstore.csv dataset, I built interactive dashboards that highlight key business insights through clean, meaningful visuals.

🎯 Objective

To create visualizations that communicate a clear and compelling business story using Tableau.
The focus was not just on charts, but on insights, clarity, and storytelling.

🛠 Tools Used

Tableau Public

Dataset: Superstore.csv

📝 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Importing & Understanding the Data

Loaded Superstore.csv into Tableau.

Explored key fields such as Sales, Profit, Category, Sub-Category, Region, State, Ship Mode, and Customer Segment.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation (Inside Tableau)

Performed light cleaning using Tableau’s built-in features:

Verified data types of each column

Renamed fields for readability

Created calculated fields such as:

Profit Ratio = Profit / Sales

Standardized date fields

Removed irrelevant/unnecessary fields

This ensured that dashboards remained clean, simple, and easy to interpret.

3️⃣ Visualization Building

I created clear, purposeful visualizations that follow best practices:
✔ choosing the right chart
✔ avoiding clutter
✔ keeping colors minimal
✔ focusing on insights

Below are the main visuals in the dashboard:

✔ Sales & Profit Trend (Line Chart)

Monthly view of Sales and Profit

Helped identify seasonal sales spikes and profit drops

✔ Category & Sub-Category Performance (Bar Charts)

Compared all product categories by both Sales & Profit

Highlighted high-performing and loss-making sub-categories

✔ Regional & State-Level Sales (Map View)

Geographic filled map showing revenue distribution

Helped understand which regions contribute most to business

✔ Customer Segment Distribution (Pie / Donut Chart)

Showed the share of Consumer, Corporate, Home Office customers

✔ Shipping Mode Performance (Bar Chart)

Compared all shipping methods and their sales contribution

4️⃣ Business Insights — Key Takeaways

The dashboard highlights several actionable insights:

Technology is the most profitable category.

Furniture shows significant profit losses in multiple states.

West region consistently performs the best.

Central region has the lowest profit ratio.

Sub-categories like Tables and Bookcases report recurring losses.

Sales spike during end-of-year months, indicating seasonal demand.

These insights were visually narrated across all dashboards and summary pages.

5️⃣ Tableau Story / Summary Slide

A final storyboard was created to present findings in a structured narrative:

Overview & KPIs

Trend and performance charts

Regional analysis

Category insights

Problem areas

Final recommendations

The story was exported as a PDF visual report.
